**“Here’s the idea for the application:
It’s a lottery app with multiple types of lotteries:

• Instant (Spin-the-Wheel)
• Weekly
• Bi-weekly
• Monthly

In the instant mode, there’s a wheel where users can win $2, $5, or $10 prizes, or tickets for the weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly lotteries.

In the weekly mode, there are 6 winners, and the pool is split evenly among them.
In the bi-weekly mode, there are 3 winners, and the pool is divided evenly.
In the monthly mode, there is one big winner who gets the entire pool.

To participate:
• Instant: the user pays $0.50
• Weekly: $1 per ticket
• Bi-weekly: $5 per ticket
• Monthly: $20 per ticket

In instant mode, 100% of the user’s payment goes to the pool.
In weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly modes, 80% goes to the pool and 20% goes to the treasury.

In instant mode, the wheel spins immediately after payment. If the user wins, they can claim instantly or take their prize as a ticket for another lottery.

In weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly modes, the draw happens automatically at the scheduled time.
Winners are displayed below the lottery page, and a user whose wallet is a winner will see a “Claim” button next to their name.

At the top of each lottery page (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly), there is a countdown timer until the draw.

There is also a bar showing:
• How many tickets the user bought
• The current pool balance
• How much the user would win at the current ETH price

Payments are in ETH, but the USD equivalent must be shown at the time of purchase.

On the weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly pages, there is a slider allowing the user to select multiple tickets at once, plus a manual input field where they can enter the exact amount of ETH they want to pay.

A bar also shows the split: 80% going to the pool and 20% to the treasury.

There is another tab for payment history where users can see the date and amount of each payment.

The contract also needs the ability to change the ticket prices and percentages later if needed.
There must also be a mechanism for manually triggering the draw in case the automated draw fails.

Now build the full frontend for this app idea I gave you at the beginning.
Design all the pages with complete graphical details so I can have the final, polished, and beautiful frontend code for it.”**
